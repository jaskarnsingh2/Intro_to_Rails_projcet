<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>In my database, I have two tables: <strong>Books</strong> and <strong>Magazines</strong>.  
   The <strong>Books</strong> table has six columns: "id", "title", "authors", "published_date", "created_at", and "updated_at".</p>
<p>The <strong>Magazines</strong> table has seven columns: "id", "title", "author", "published_date", "publisher", "created_at", "updated_at", and "book_id".  
   There is a one-to-many relationship between Books and Magazines, meaning one book can have many magazines.</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<ul>
  <% @data_sources.each do |source| %>
    <li><strong><%= source[:name] %>:</strong> <%= source[:description] %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset Description</h2>

<p>In this project, we use two main datasets: <strong>Books</strong> and <strong>Magazines</strong>.</p>

<h3>Books Dataset</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> CSV file</li>
  <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Each book contains an ID, title, authors, and published date.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Data is read from a CSV file and stored in the <code>books</code> table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Magazines Dataset</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> Faker Gem (Randomly Generated Data)</li>
  <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Each magazine has an ID, title, author, published date, publisher, and a reference to a book.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Generated dynamically using Faker and stored in the <code>magazines</code> table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Each book can have <strong>up to 5 magazines</strong> linked to it. The <code>magazines</code> table has a foreign key <code>book_id</code> that establishes this relationship.</p>
